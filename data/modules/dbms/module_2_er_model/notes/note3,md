### Weak Entity and Advanced ER Concepts

Weak Entity

A Weak Entity is an entity that does not have a primary key of its own.

It depends on a Strong Entity for identification.

Example:
Dependent entity depends on Employee.

Characteristics:
- Has partial key
- Connected through identifying relationship

Identifying Relationship

Relationship that connects weak entity to strong entity.

Generalization

Process of combining lower-level entities into higher-level entity.

Example:
Car and Bike generalized into Vehicle.

Specialization

Process of dividing higher-level entity into lower-level entities.

Example:
Employee specialized into Manager and Engineer.

Aggregation

Used when relationship itself participates in another relationship.

Exam Notes:
- Weak entity always has total participation.
- Generalization = bottom-up approach.
- Specialization = top-down approach.
