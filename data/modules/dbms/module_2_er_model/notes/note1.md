### Entities and Attributes

An Entity represents a real-world object or concept that can be uniquely identified.

Examples:
- Student
- Employee
- Course
- Department

An Entity Set is a collection of similar entities.

Example:
All students in a university form the Student entity set.

Attributes

Attributes describe properties of an entity.

Example:
Student entity may have:
- Roll_Number
- Name
- Age
- Address

Types of Attributes:

1. Simple Attribute  
   Cannot be divided further.  
   Example: Age

2. Composite Attribute  
   Can be divided into smaller parts.  
   Example: Address (Street, City, State)

3. Single-Valued Attribute  
   Has only one value.  
   Example: Date_of_Birth

4. Multi-Valued Attribute  
   Can have multiple values.  
   Example: Phone_Number

5. Derived Attribute  
   Can be calculated from other attributes.  
   Example: Age derived from Date_of_Birth

Primary Key

A Primary Key uniquely identifies each entity in an entity set.

Example:
Roll_Number uniquely identifies a Student.

A primary key:
- Cannot be NULL
- Must be unique

Exam Notes:
- Define entity and entity set clearly.
- Explain all attribute types with examples.
- Primary key definition is frequently asked.
