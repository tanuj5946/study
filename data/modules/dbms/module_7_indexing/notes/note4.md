### Hashing

Hashing uses hash function to map keys to storage locations.

Types:

1. Static Hashing
   Fixed number of buckets.

2. Dynamic Hashing
   Directory size can grow.
   Example: Extendible hashing.

Advantages:
- Fast equality search.

Disadvantages:
- Not good for range queries.

Query Processing

Steps in Query Processing:

1. Parsing
2. Optimization
3. Execution

Query Optimization

DBMS selects the most efficient query execution plan.

Cost-based optimization considers:
- Disk I/O
- CPU cost
- Memory usage

Exam Notes:
- Static vs Dynamic hashing important.
- Query optimization is theory question.
