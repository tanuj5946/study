### Database Concepts

Data refers to raw facts and figures such as numbers, text, or symbols.
Information is processed data that is meaningful and useful.

A database is an organized collection of related data stored in a structured format.
A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to define, create,
maintain, and control access to the database.

Examples of DBMS:
- MySQL
- Oracle
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server

Objectives of DBMS:
- Store large amounts of data
- Provide efficient data retrieval
- Reduce redundancy
- Maintain data consistency
- Ensure data security

Characteristics of DBMS:

1. Data Abstraction  
   Hides internal implementation details from users.

2. Data Independence  
   Changes in physical storage do not affect logical structure.

3. Reduced Redundancy  
   Avoids duplication of data.

4. Consistency  
   Ensures uniform data across system.

5. Concurrency Control  
   Allows multiple users to access data simultaneously.

6. Backup and Recovery  
   Protects data from failures.

Advantages of DBMS:
- Improved data sharing
- Better data integrity
- Enhanced security
- Efficient query processing

Exam Notes:
- Define DBMS clearly.
- Differentiate data vs information.
- List at least 5 characteristics.
