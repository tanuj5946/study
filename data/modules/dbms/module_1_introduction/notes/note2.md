### File System vs DBMS

Before DBMS, data was stored in file systems.

Limitations of File System:

1. Data Redundancy  
   Same data stored in multiple files.

2. Data Inconsistency  
   Updates in one file may not reflect in others.

3. Poor Security  
   No strong access control.

4. No Concurrency Control  
   Simultaneous updates may cause errors.

5. No Backup Mechanism  
   Difficult recovery after crash.

Advantages of DBMS over File System:

1. Controlled Redundancy  
   Centralized database reduces duplication.

2. Data Consistency  
   Updates reflect everywhere.

3. Improved Security  
   Authentication and authorization support.

4. Concurrency Control  
   Locking and transaction mechanisms.

5. Data Integrity Constraints  
   Primary key, foreign key, etc.

Comparison Table:

File System:
- Separate files
- Manual management
- Weak security

DBMS:
- Centralized database
- Automated management
- Strong security

Exam Notes:
- Always compare in points.
- Mention redundancy and concurrency clearly.
