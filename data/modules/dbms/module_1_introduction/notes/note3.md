### Data Models and Three-Level Architecture

A data model describes how data is stored, organized, and manipulated.

Types of Data Models:

1. Hierarchical Model  
   Data organized in tree structure.

2. Network Model  
   Data organized as graph.

3. Relational Model  
   Data stored in tables (most widely used).

4. Object-Oriented Model  
   Combines database with object-oriented programming.

Three-Level Architecture:

The ANSI/SPARC architecture defines three levels:

1. External Level (View Level)  
   User-specific view of data.

2. Conceptual Level (Logical Level)  
   Logical structure of entire database.

3. Internal Level (Physical Level)  
   Physical storage structure.

Advantages of Three-Level Architecture:

- Logical Data Independence  
- Physical Data Independence  
- Security through views  

Data Independence:

Logical Data Independence:
Ability to change conceptual schema without affecting external schema.

Physical Data Independence:
Ability to change internal schema without affecting conceptual schema.

Exam Notes:
- Draw diagram in exam.
- Define logical vs physical independence clearly.
