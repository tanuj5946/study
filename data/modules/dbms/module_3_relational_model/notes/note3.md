Relational algebra is a procedural query language.

It defines operations to manipulate relations.

Basic Operations:

1. Selection (σ)  
   Select rows satisfying condition.

2. Projection (π)  
   Select specific columns.

3. Union (∪)  
   Combine tuples of two relations.

4. Set Difference (-)  
   Tuples in one relation but not in another.

5. Cartesian Product (×)  
   Combine every tuple of one relation with another.

6. Rename (ρ)  
   Rename relation.

Join Operations:

1. Theta Join  
   Join with condition.

2. Equi Join  
   Join using equality condition.

3. Natural Join  
   Join on common attributes.

Example:

σ Dept='CSE' (Student)

Exam Notes:
- Symbols may be asked in exams.
- Practice writing relational algebra expressions.
