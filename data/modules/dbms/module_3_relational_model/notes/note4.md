### Relational Calculus

Relational calculus is a non-procedural query language.

It describes what to retrieve, not how.

Types:

1. Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)  
   Variables represent tuples.

2. Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)  
   Variables represent domain values.

Difference between Relational Algebra and Calculus:

Relational Algebra:
- Procedural
- Specifies sequence of operations

Relational Calculus:
- Non-procedural
- Specifies condition to satisfy

Safety of Expressions

A relational calculus expression must be safe,
meaning it should produce finite results.

Exam Notes:
- Know procedural vs non-procedural difference.
- TRC and DRC definitions are important.
