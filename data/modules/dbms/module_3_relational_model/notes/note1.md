### Relational Model

The Relational Model was proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.

In the relational model, data is stored in the form of tables.

A table is called a Relation.
A row is called a Tuple.
A column is called an Attribute.
The number of rows is called Cardinality.
The number of columns is called Degree.

Example:

Student Table

| Roll_No | Name   | Dept |
|---------|--------|------|
| 101     | Amit   | CSE  |

Keys in Relational Model

1. Super Key  
   A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.

2. Candidate Key  
   Minimal super key.

3. Primary Key  
   One candidate key chosen to uniquely identify tuples.

4. Alternate Key  
   Candidate keys not selected as primary key.

5. Foreign Key  
   Attribute that references primary key of another relation.

Properties of Relations

- No duplicate tuples
- Order of rows does not matter
- Order of columns does not matter
- Each cell contains atomic value

Exam Notes:
- Define relation, tuple, attribute clearly.
- Differences between candidate and primary key are important.
