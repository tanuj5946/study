### Fragmentation

Fragmentation occurs when memory is wasted due to inefficient
allocation.

Types of fragmentation:
- Internal fragmentation
- External fragmentation

Paging reduces external fragmentation, while segmentation may cause
external fragmentation.

Proper memory management techniques are required to reduce
fragmentation.
