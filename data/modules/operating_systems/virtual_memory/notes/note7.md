### Thrashing

Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time handling page faults
than executing processes.

It happens when too many processes compete for limited memory.

Symptoms of thrashing:
- High page fault rate
- Low CPU utilization

Thrashing can be controlled by:
- Reducing degree of multiprogramming
- Using working set model
