### Virtual Memory Concept

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows a process
to execute even if it is not completely in main memory.

It gives the illusion of a large memory space by using secondary
storage as an extension of RAM.

Virtual memory improves memory utilization and allows large programs
to run on limited physical memory.
