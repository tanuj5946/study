### Directory Structures

A directory is a special type of file that contains information about other files.

Directory structures organize files in a systematic way.

Types of directory structures:

1. Single-Level Directory
   All files are stored in one directory.

2. Two-Level Directory
   Each user has a separate directory.

3. Tree-Structured Directory
   Directories are organized in a hierarchy.

4. Acyclic Graph Directory
   Allows shared files and directories.

Advantages of hierarchical structure:
- Better organization
- Efficient searching
- Access control
