### Round Robin Scheduling

Round Robin scheduling assigns a fixed time quantum to each process.

Each process gets CPU for a limited time in cyclic order.

Advantages:
- Fair allocation of CPU
- Good response time

Disadvantages:
- Performance depends on time quantum size
- Too small quantum causes overhead
