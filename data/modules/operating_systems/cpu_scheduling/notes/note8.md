### Multilevel Queue Scheduling

Multilevel queue scheduling divides the ready queue into multiple
separate queues based on process type.

Each queue has its own scheduling algorithm.

Processes are permanently assigned to a queue.

Advantages:
- Efficient for different process types

Disadvantages:
- Inflexible
- Possible starvation
