### Preemptive vs Non-preemptive Scheduling

In preemptive scheduling, the CPU can be taken away from a running
process and assigned to another process.

In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process gets the CPU, it runs
until it finishes or blocks.

Preemptive Scheduling:
- Better responsiveness
- Suitable for time-sharing systems
- Higher context switching overhead

Non-preemptive Scheduling:
- Simple to implement
- Less overhead
- Poor response time
