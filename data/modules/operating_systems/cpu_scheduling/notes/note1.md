### CPU Scheduling Basics

CPU scheduling is the process of selecting one process from the ready
queue to allocate the CPU.

Since multiple processes compete for CPU time, the operating system
uses scheduling algorithms to decide which process should execute next.

Efficient CPU scheduling improves system performance and responsiveness.
