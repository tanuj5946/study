### Scheduling Criteria

Scheduling criteria are used to evaluate and compare CPU scheduling
algorithms.

Common scheduling criteria include:

1. CPU Utilization  
   The percentage of time the CPU is busy.

2. Throughput  
   Number of processes completed per unit time.

3. Turnaround Time  
   Time taken from process submission to completion.

4. Waiting Time  
   Total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.

5. Response Time  
   Time between request submission and first response.

An ideal scheduling algorithm optimizes these criteria.
