### Semaphore

A semaphore is a synchronization tool that uses an integer value
to control access to shared resources.

Two atomic operations are used:
- wait (P)
- signal (V)

Types of semaphores:
- Binary semaphore
- Counting semaphore

Semaphores are widely used to solve synchronization problems.
