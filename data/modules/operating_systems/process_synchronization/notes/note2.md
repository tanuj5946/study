### Race Condition

A race condition occurs when the output of a program depends on the
timing or order of execution of concurrent processes.

Race conditions usually arise when processes access shared data
without proper synchronization.

Race conditions can cause:
- Data inconsistency
- Unpredictable program behavior
- System errors

Synchronization mechanisms are used to prevent race conditions.
