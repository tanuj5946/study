### Mutual Exclusion

Mutual exclusion ensures that only one process can access a shared
resource at any given time.

It is a fundamental requirement of the critical section problem.

Mutual exclusion can be achieved using:
- Locks
- Semaphores
- Mutexes
- Monitors

Without mutual exclusion, race conditions may occur.
