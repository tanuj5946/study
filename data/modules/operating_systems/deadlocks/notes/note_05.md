### Deadlock Avoidance (Banker's Algorithm)

Deadlock avoidance requires advance information about resource
requirements of processes.

The system checks whether granting a resource request will keep the
system in a safe state.

Banker's Algorithm is the most commonly used deadlock avoidance
algorithm.

A safe state ensures that all processes can complete execution
without deadlock.
