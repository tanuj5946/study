The following four conditions must hold simultaneously for a deadlock
to occur:<br>

1. Mutual Exclusion : Resources cannot be shared. <br> 
2. Hold and Wait : A process holds at least one resource and waits for others.<br>
3. No Preemption : Resources cannot be forcibly taken.<br>  
4. Circular Wait : A circular chain of processes exists.<br>

If any one of these conditions is prevented, deadlock can be avoided.
