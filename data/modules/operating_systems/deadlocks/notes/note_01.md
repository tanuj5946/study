### Deadlock Basics

A deadlock is a situation in which a set of processes are blocked
because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another
resource held by another process.

In a deadlock, none of the processes can proceed.

Deadlocks commonly occur in systems with multiple processes competing
for limited resources.
