### Deadlock Prevention

Deadlock prevention ensures that at least one of the necessary
conditions for deadlock never holds.

Prevention techniques include:
- Eliminating hold and wait
- Allowing resource preemption
- Imposing an ordering on resource requests

Deadlock prevention may lead to low resource utilization.
