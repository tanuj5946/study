### Resource Allocation Graph

A resource allocation graph is a directed graph used to represent
resource allocation and requests in a system.

The graph consists of:
- Process nodes
- Resource nodes
- Request edges
- Assignment edges

If the graph contains a cycle, a deadlock may exist.

Resource allocation graphs are useful for deadlock detection.
