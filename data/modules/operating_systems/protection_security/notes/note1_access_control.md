### Access Control

Access control determines how resources are protected from unauthorized use.

The Access Matrix model defines rights of subjects over objects.

Access Control Lists (ACL):
- Attach permissions to objects.
- Define which users can access resources.

Capabilities:
- Assign access rights directly to users.
- Improve flexibility.

Access control ensures system security and controlled resource usage.
