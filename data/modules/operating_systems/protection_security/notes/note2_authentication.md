### Authentication

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or process.

Common authentication methods:
- Password-based authentication
- Biometric authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

MFA combines two or more factors:
- Something you know
- Something you have
- Something you are

Strong authentication reduces unauthorized access.
