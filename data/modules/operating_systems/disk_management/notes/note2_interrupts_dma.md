### Interrupts and DMA

Interrupts allow devices to notify the CPU when an operation is complete.

Interrupt-driven I/O improves CPU efficiency by avoiding busy waiting.

Direct Memory Access (DMA):
- Allows devices to transfer data directly to memory
- Reduces CPU involvement
- Improves system performance

DMA is commonly used for high-speed data transfer.
