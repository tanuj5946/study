### Context Switching

Context switching is the process of saving the state of a running
process and loading the state of another process.

It allows multitasking and CPU sharing.

Steps involved:
- Save current process context in PCB
- Load next process context
- Resume execution

Context switching introduces overhead but is essential for
multiprogramming systems.
