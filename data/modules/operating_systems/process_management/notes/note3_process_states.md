### Process States

A process goes through different states during execution:

1. New – Process is being created
2. Ready – Waiting to be assigned to CPU
3. Running – Instructions are being executed
4. Waiting – Waiting for I/O or event
5. Terminated – Finished execution

The operating system manages transitions between these states.
