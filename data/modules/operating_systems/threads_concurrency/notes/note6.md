### Many-to-Many Model

In the many-to-many model, multiple user threads are mapped to a smaller
or equal number of kernel threads.

Advantages:
- Combines benefits of one-to-one and many-to-one models
- Supports concurrency and scalability

Disadvantages:
- Complex to implement

This model allows flexible thread management.
