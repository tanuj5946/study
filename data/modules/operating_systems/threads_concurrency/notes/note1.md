### Thread Concept

A thread is the smallest unit of CPU execution within a process.
A process may contain multiple threads that share the same address
space and resources.

Each thread has its own:
- Program counter
- Register set
- Stack

Threads within the same process share:
- Code section
- Data section
- Open files

Threads are also called lightweight processes.
