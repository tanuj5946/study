### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer.

Each VM runs its own operating system and applications independently.

Advantages:
- Isolation between systems
- Better resource utilization
- Easy testing and deployment

Virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run on a single hardware system.
