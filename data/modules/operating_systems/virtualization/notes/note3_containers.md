### Containers

Containers provide lightweight virtualization.

They share the host operating system kernel but isolate applications.

Advantages:
- Faster startup time
- Lower overhead than VMs
- Efficient resource usage

Difference between VM and Container:
- VM includes full OS
- Container shares host OS
